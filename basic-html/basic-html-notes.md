## VS Code Shortcuts

`! + tab` gives us boiler plate code

`alt + arrows (up or down)` will take what you highlighted and move it up or down.

windows: `ctrl + /` mac: `command + /` if you want to make a comment. You DO NOT have to select the entire row if you want to comment it.  Only highlight if you want to select multiple lines of code.
