    <h1>John Isabella</h1>

        <h1>Two Truths and a Lie</h1>
            <h3>I learned Shakespeare 48 hours</h3>
            <p>Last Summer, I was in a performance of As You Like It, as a minor character.  During Tech week, one of the leads could not make it and the director decided to give the part to me.  I had 2 days to learn the show.  <strong>I was ready opening night.</strong></p>
            <h3>I was named Captain of the Quiditch Team</h3>
            <p>After the release of the "Half-Blood Prince" our local Barnes and Noble had a Quiditch Tournement.  My sister and I brought our brooms and I was asked to be one of the Captains since I dressed the part. <strong>My team lost,</strong> because one of my players got in a fight with their brother who was on another team.</p>
            <h3>I proposed to my wife in a trash can.</h3>
            <p>Two years ago, I took my 'then girlfriend' to the riverfront.  Once there I got her to take some pictures with around the park.  Then when she wasn't expecting it I popped out of a trash can with a ring and asked her to marry me.  <strong>She said YES!</strong> Now we are married.</p>
